# Active-regulatory-regions-prediction-Deep-neural-networks - Bioinformatics Project - Paolo Cortis
Deep supervised learning methods applied to identify the position of active/inactive cis-regulatory regions (CRRs), including both enhancers and promoters.

The project focuses on learning how to construct the models and design sound experimental procedures to obtain statistically reliable results.
